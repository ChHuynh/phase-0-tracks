 the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags helps us seperate our code into chunks that are relevant to each other, its a way to keep the document easy to read, as well as modify.

 the order the browser displays elements pretty much just displays the code in the order it was written in.

 I learned a few quick commands to help me quickly type out lines of the same code, as well as being able to modify specific sets of the same code in multiple lines or rows quickly. I can also see snippets becoming really useful later on, when designing templates for certain things.

 The different semantic tags felt a bit like a lot of different tags that didnt seem super  helpful right away, but I think after speaking to my pairing partner, and my guide, it was a bit easier to wrap my head around that. figuring out how snippets worked was a bit challenging as well.
