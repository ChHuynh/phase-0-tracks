<h1>Why Avocados are My Spirit Animal</h1>
<p> There are many reasons why I personally consider the avocado my spirit animal. Before we start going over the reasons why, I thought I would have you watch the video below to get an idea of where I am coming from. It might not make sense but I suppose these things just happen. Naturally, Avocados are delicious, but just being delicious alone isnt enough to make me consider making it my spirit animal now would it? Theres also the fact that avocados arent animals, but thats OK too.
