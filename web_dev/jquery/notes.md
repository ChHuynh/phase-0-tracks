1. google/wiki to get a basic understanding of what jquery is
2. look for some beginner guides, try it out
3. look through some documentation
4. try using different documentation and see how they work
5. lots of sandbox testing

	I went through a few tutorials on youtube, and looked at documentation on w3s schools and on the jquery website and got a basic idea of how jquery works.
	I decided the best way to test it would be to use the html file from 9.2 module to see if I could make the page a little bit better.
